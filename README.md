# Home Office Digital (HOD) Inclusion Scale Plotter - Alpha
Simple tool to provide HOD User Researchers with a toolkit to aid them in plotting research participants on the Digital Inclusion Scale with accuracy. To that end the toolkit will be automating the coding process and it is intended that over a number of itteration the accuracy of this coding process can be improved. This toolkit is designed to fucntion without an internet connection for in the field research sessions. 

Created internally at Home Office Digital - not supported, not created by GDS.

This is not finished! It's Alpha Alpha!

## Getting Started

#### You will need:
- A mac (sorry, this isn't tested on PCs yet)

- Download a zip of this repository from https://github.com/tjharrop/digital-inclusion-plotter/archive/Digital-Inclusion-Scale.zip and unzip it to your computer

## Running the thing

There are 2 options here. You can either open index.html in Safari or Firefox directly or you can run a small script which will allow you to use chrome.

#### Using Safari or Firefox
1. Cmd + click index.html in Finder
2. Open With
3. Select Safari or Firefox

#### Using Chrome (recommended)

_You may see an unauthorised developer warning message. If you do, cmd + click and click "open" instead (thanks Joe)_

1. Double click run.command (see above if you get a warning)
2. In chrome, go to http://localhost:1987/

#TODO

_Not all of these are things to be included, they are suggestions, ideas and prompts for future development._

##Design crit feedback

###Metadata
- Plain English
- Change page heading

###Form
- Suggest the questions are phrased so that they can be read out by the researcher (or participant) without having to be rephrased
- Suggest separating the blocks of Yes and No radio answers. Perhaps some colour and/or tick/cross icons too.
- Home doesn’t necessarily = Broadband
- Suggest ‘Desktop’ and ‘Laptop’ are the main options to be consistent with ’Tablet’ etrc. The explanation of ‘PC/Mac’ may not be necessary but if included for completeness you could have Linux too
- Suggest ‘Yearly or less’
- The answers to the Ability to get online  question don’t make sense.
- Extra ‘to’ in ‘confident to learning to’
- Suggest ‘unconfident’ instead of ‘unsure’
- Wording of the ‘Action/Activity’ categories need proofing and making consistent
- Add tick/cross iconography to toggles

###Chart
- Separate key to run through 9 points of scale
- Export is great
- Double plotted chart - join researcher and participant on scale
- Double plotted chart - Arrow pointing in the direction of the actual participant score

###Ideas
- Performance dashboard for particular project
- Track trends across projects
- Sync when back online
- Device based digital inclusion scale
- More then one point on scale - one for mobile and tablet / one for desktop
- Hierarchy of action buttons - one major plus secondary
